<p align=center>Descentralized network protocol for sending and receiving secure messages over an secure layer.</p>

## What is the Starless Sky Protocol?

The Starless Sky Protocol is a one-to-many messaging connection protocol written in PHP that maintains data integrity and has unique and advanced encryption features. Its construction consists of RESTful APIs that do not depend of a database to function. The relationship of information is made by hashes calculations and asymmetric cryptography, where the holder of the private key has a public key that is used to receive the messages.

The algorithm is customizable by an environment file and centralized on servers known as "networks". Users can create their own networks or use existing networks. Each network may contain its own algorithm for handling information. It is interesting to note that the existence of malicious networks can exist.

## Private Keys vs Public Keys

The idea of private keys and public keys is that one directly depends on the other. A public key is irreversible and cannot have the private key decrypted, but it is possible to calculate the public key from a private key. This indicates that a private key is the master access for that sender/receiver.

> The project is still under development and its algorithm is also being developed. Some security issues may change in the future, along with how it works.

## Main Features

- Decentralized networks;
- Anonymous identities without revealing the real identity of both sender and receiver;
- Based on symmetric and asymmetric encryption, no information is stored in plain text in the network storage.
- Keys and values are never stored directly in the network storage;
- Fast and instant content delivery network - no network authenticity required;
- Easy implementation and use.

## Roadmap

- Broadcasting channels (one-to-many communication);
- Groups (many-to-many communication);
- Interface application;
- Closed-generation servers;
- Private Keys authentication for networks;
- Content integrity if network information changes;
